# JEStart

The "Xenoage Java Exe Starter" was a useful tool for Java developers, maintained until 2006.

It generates a windows executable (.exe) with an icon, that starts a runnable Java archive (.jar) when it is launched. A certain JRE version can be demanded
and the .jar can be embedded in the .exe file.

This tool was used for the game [Bolzplatz 2006](https://github.com/Xenoage/Bolzplatz2006) for example.
